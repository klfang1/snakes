# 🐍 Snakes

A personal project to practice game development by recreating and expanding on the classic **Snake** game using **Python** and **Pygame**.

---

## 🎯 Goals

1. ✅ Create the original snake game in Python/Pygame *(current milestone)*  
2. ⏳ Implement layered maps — like a “tower” mode where the snake climbs to higher floors.
